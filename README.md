# Text-swapper

This little chrome/ff extension will allow the user to select text and then decide what they would like the text swapped as.  My banks don't allow me to name my accounts so I created this extension to be able to select my account number and rename.

The user would select some text and then using the context window inform the plugin that they want to swap the text with something.  The next time they are on any page where that text appears the plugin will swap it out.
